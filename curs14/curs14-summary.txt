Palindrome Problem:
A palindrome is a word that is the same if you read it from left to right or from right to left

Solution 1:
- reverse the string, check if it is equal with the original one
ex. 
potop
reversed: potop
potop == potop? YES

solution 2:
- compare the first letter with the last one, the second with the last - 1

eg
potop
compare letter 0 to 4 -> p==p  YES
compare letter 1 to 3 -> o==o  YES
compare letter 2 to 2 -> t==t  YES
